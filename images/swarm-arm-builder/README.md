Builds an ARM compatible docker swarm binary through Docker
============================================================

### Depends on alexellis2/arm-go:1.5

For the article, this is prebuilt and available in the swarm-arm folder.

If you wish to rebuild its binary from source run build.sh and then copy ./binary/swarm to ../swarm-arm/ and 
rebuild the container.
